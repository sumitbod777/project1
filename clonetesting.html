one day my father has told me son dont let it slip away 
He took me in as I heard him say 
When you get older U bow out ]U live for younger days thinking of me of ever your place she said one day you will
leave this world behind so never lie if you will remember my father told me you are not a just a child these are the nights to live by my father
